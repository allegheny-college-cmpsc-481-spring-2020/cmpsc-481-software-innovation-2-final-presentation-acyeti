## Turning in the assignment

### Writing

All reports should be turned in using Markdown files extant in the `writing` directory of this repository. As stipulated in the Syllabus [in the course-materials repository](https://github.com/allegheny-college-cmpsc-481-spring-2020/course-materials), the writer should spearhead the effort. However, this does not mean that they alone should complete it. These reports require input and contribution from the entire group.

### Surveys

This survey will be distributed to you via our course's [Slack channel](http://cmpsc-481-sp-2020.slack.com) as we near the end of the module.
